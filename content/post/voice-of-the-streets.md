Among the films that released in 2019, there was a film that created a lot of excitement and it was Gully Boy. Gully Boy shares a fictional story about a 22 year slum boy who desperately desires to become a rapper and all this somewhere from the slums of Bombay. Directed by Zoya Akhtar and played by Ranveer Sing this film is considered to be heavily influenced by the life of a Hip-Hop artist from Bombay named Vivian Fernandes aka Divine.

One of the main reasons for the popularity of Divine is because his projects are some authentic hip-hop in India. This new-age desi rapper talks about corruption, lackadaisical governments, police brutality, family apathy, militancy and any issue that pushes him to speak out in a language that everyone from a roadside hawker to a rickshaw guy to a businessman would understand and thus becoming a window into the reality of contemporary India.

But this was never music. Music was always considered to be something pleasant that voiced love and sorrow and in a sophisticated language with careful choice of words. Then why this? And to understand this we need to dig deep to the roots of rap culture.

Rap is often associated with, and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The English word rap means “to utter sharply of vigorously” which also turns up to be a slang word for “speaking to someone or conversation”.

Thousands of years ago in Africa “griots”, the village story tellers used to tell stories about their life and daily events with the help of hand-made musical instruments. This griot tradition got carried over when Africans were captivated and carried to America for slavery. To cope with the tremendous pain and pressure of slavery they would sing out while working or relaxing. And years after this started to take a more structured form on August 11, 1973 in the Bronx, New York when Clive Campbell (a Jamaican-American) and his sister Cindy began hosting parties in their house. And in these gathering a new culture would ignite which we know today as Hip-Hop. One night he tried something new called “merry go round” where he used two turn tables playing the same break beat section of James Brown record “clap your hands”. This allowed him to extend that section of the song as long as he wanted. This technique later came to be known as looping which is now used by most DJs.

Campbell soon became popular and took up the stage name DJ Cool Herc and thus becoming the first DJ and father of hip-hop. As Campbell continued to do more parties he soon realised that speaking on the mic was just as important as DJing was. In order to accomplish this he reached out to his good friend Coke La Rock to be the first dedicated MC of these parties. During one of these parties Coke La Rock spit his very first bar, “There’s not a man that can’t be thrown, not a horse that can’t be rode, a bull that can’t be stopped, there’s not a disco that I Coke La Rock can’t rock”. This one bar made Coke La Rock the very first rapper in Hip-Hop and birthed a new genre of music we know today as Rap music.

Within the next few years DJ’s and Rappers were popping up at every block party to showcase their talent but record companies considered rap music a fad and was not compelled to invest into it. Rap music finally reached mainstream recognition in 1979. The first rap song to get commercially released was “King Tim III (Personality Jock)” by the Fatback Band. However this song was pushed to the B-side of the tape but after getting a huge response from the clubs it was later released on the A-side and became a top 30 hit on R&B charts.

In the winter of that same year a rap group emerged called Sugar Hill Gang comprised of Englewood, New Jersey natives Michael “Wonder Mike” Wright, Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson, and Guy “Master Gee” O’Brien. They released a rap song titled “Rappers Delight”. This song was over 14 minutes long and used the “Good Times by Chic” sample in the background. Rappers Delight went on to achieve the top 40 billboard spot in 1980.

And with this history was made. What was once considered to be just fad rapidly grew into the most popular genre of music of this decade. Rap is all about words and beats. Language and background was never a barrier for it. With this we hope that many more gully boys will express themselves and discover the society in their own style and lyrics as never before.
