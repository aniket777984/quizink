If we are to make a massive investment in a new transportation system, then the return should by rights be equally massive.

<!--more-->

Compared to the all alternatives, it should ideally be:

- Safer
- Faster
- Lower cost
- More convenient
- Immune to weather
- Sustainably self-powering
- Resistant to Earthquakes
- Not disruptive to those along the route

Is there truly a new mode of transport – a fifth mode after planes, trains, cars and boats – that meets those criteria and is practical to implement? Many ideas for a system with most of those properties have been proposed and should be acknowledged.

**Hyperloop** is the only latest innovative ideas which can change the actual idea of the transportation world upside down.

## What is Hyperloop?

Hyperloop is a new mode of transport that seeks to change this paradigm by being both fast and inexpensive for people and goods. Hyperloop is also unique in that it is an open design concept, similar to Linux.

Hyperloop consists of a low pressure tube with capsules that are transported at both low and high speeds throughout the length of the tube. The capsules are supported on a cushion of air, featuring pressurized air and aerodynamic lift. The capsules are accelerated via a magnetic linear accelerator affixed at various stations on the low pressure tube with rotors contained in each capsule. Passengers may enter and exit Hyperloop at stations located either at the ends of the tube, or branches along the tube length.

## So how does a passenger benefit from it?

It is also worth noting the energy cost of this system is less than any currently existing mode of transport, after all money matters?
The only system that comes close to matching the low energy requirements of Hyperloop is the fully electric Tesla Model S.

## What Does it look like?

The geometry of the tube depends on the choice of either the passenger version of Hyperloop or the passenger plus vehicles version of Hyperloop.

In either case, if the speed of the air passing through the gaps accelerates to supersonic velocities, then shock waves form. These waves limit how much air can actually get out of the way of the capsule, building up a column of air in front of its nose and increasing drag until the air pressure builds up significantly in front of the capsule. With the increased drag and additional mass of air to push, the power requirements for the capsule increase significantly. It is therefore very important to avoid shock wave formation around the capsule by careful selecting of the capsule/tube area ratio. This ensures sufficient mass air flow around and through the capsule at all operating speeds. Any air that cannot pass around the annulus between the capsule and tube is bypassed using the onboard compressor in each capsule.

## What is the approximate cost for a hyper loop?

The overall cost of the Hyperloop passenger capsule version is expected to be under $1.35 million USD including manufacturing and assembly cost. With 40 capsules required for the expected demand, the total cost of capsules for the Hyperloop system should be no more than $54 million USD or approximately 1% of the total budget.

## Hyperloop: who's making it?

This is where things get interesting, as for most of its existence Hyperloop’s development has been powered by startups. After publishing the white paper, Elon Musk handed over the responsibility by challenging startups to see who could actually bring the technology to market.

The important thing to remember, which admittedly is a little tricky, is that Hyperloop is effectively the name of the product, not the company. Most of the companies have Hyperloop in the title, but there isn't a company that is Hyperloop.

The two main contenders at the moment are [Hyperloop One](https://hyperloop-one.com/), and [Hyperloop Transportation Technologies](http://hyperloop.global/), with the recent addition of Arrivo, which is chaired by ex-Hyperloop One CTO and ex-SpaceX engineer, Brogan BamBrogan. Yes, that’s actually his name. 
On top of this, Musk runs a Hyperloop Challenge, where he welcomes students to his Hyperloop test lab in his SpaceX facility in Las Vegas.

In the latest trials, a team of 30 students from Germany called [WARR Hyperloop](http://hyperloop.warr.de) won with a top speed of 201 mph. That's a long way off the proposed top speed that Musk thinks Hyperloop can reach but it's still pretty impressive.
